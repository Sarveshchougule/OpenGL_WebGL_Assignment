### Question ###
Create 3D tiles with custom building data and write a 3D tile set visualizer in ThreeJS.
3D tiles is a new 3D data streaming standard that can be used for visualizing large 3D areas.
You need to create a tile set with custom data using Cesium Ion. The custom buildings for now can be a bunch of cubes. (No need to create new 3D models).
The data uploaded to Cesium ion should be visualized using a 3D Tile Visualizer. Please refer to the Cesium viewer and implement the same in the solution.
